# Trailblazer
Trailblazer Program in C++

This is .cpp file for trailblazer. When clicking on any two points in a graph, the program will find a path from the starting position to the ending position. Once the path is found, the program will highlight it and display information about the path cost in the console. The user can select one of four path-searching algorithms in the top menu: depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search. Also the program provides a Kruskal algorithm to create mazes
  in a graph.
